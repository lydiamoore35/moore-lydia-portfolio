      <div class="AboutDetails">
        As a student in General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive course for full-stack development, I have embraced my keen attention to detail and goal completion determination to accomplish multiple projects to their fullest extent. I practice effective time allocation and maintain a detail-oriented workflow allowing me the necessary time to anticipate the needs of team members and instructors. I aspire to establish myself as a developer within a reputable and mission-driven company that will actively cultivate the strengths of its creators.
